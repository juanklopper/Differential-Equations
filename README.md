# Intorduction to Ordinary Differential Equations
These are Jupyter notebooks of my notes on differential equations.  It is an introductory course and teaches both the mathematical concepts of ordinary differential equations and how to solve them using Python.
Initially it concentrates on analytical techniques and uses *sympy*.  Further down the line *scipy* is used when numerical techniques are introduced.
